## SOLID principles
### Single responsibility
Each class or method should have a single responsibility for easy testing.
### Open/closed
Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
### Liskov substitution
A parent class should be replaceable with a child class.
### Interface segregation
Lots of smaller interfaces with focused roles are better than one big general purpose interface.
### Dependency inversion
A class should not depend on another class inside it, the other class should be constructed outside of the class to prevent construction parameter dependencies, it can be replaced with an abstract interface.
